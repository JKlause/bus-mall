# User Stories for Bus Mall

## Focus Group Participant

### Shelly
Shelly is so excited about having a bus mall catalog to look at her on her frequent trips between Boston and NYC. 
She regularly buys ridiculously expensive things that she will never need to help her cope with the fact that she
had an abusive, alcoholic father. She is most excited about looking at these products to try to satisfy an unquenchable thirst for love and acceptance from the acquisition of items.

### Nick
Nick regularly uses the bus on his commute to work. He spends about one hour on his commute and likes to distract himself. However, nick can't use his phone because he gets migraines from staring at his screen too long. He is looking forward to another distraction technique from his existential rat wheel to help with his daily commute
